(Your Blue Sparrow Tech work calendar \u2014 Outlook/Exchange or Google Calendar, or another account?)\n2. Which year do you mean by \u201cMay 26th\u201d? (I won\u2019t assume the year.)\n3. By \u201cwho else\u201d do you mean all invited attendees excluding you, or only external attendees, or only required attendees?\n4. Can you grant me access to that calendar/event, or paste/share the event details or guest list? If you prefer not to share access, I can give step-by-step instructions to extract the attendee emails yourself.\n\nIf you want me to look it up, please either:\n- Connect the calendar (tell me which service and provide access), or\n- Paste the event link or a screenshot of the guest list, or\n- Export and paste the ICS/CSV content or guest list.\n\nIf you want instructions instead, tell me which calendar service (Google Calendar or Outlook), and I\u2019ll give exact steps to get the attendee emails for the May 26th \u201cNetworking event.\u201d"
